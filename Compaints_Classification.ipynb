Please take immediate action on my behalf so I can have these items removed, deleted and permanently blocked from my credit report, so that I can get back on track to a normal life. \\n\\nRegards \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           27\n",
              "I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. It has been months and I still have not received a response to my concerns. The only thing I have received is some automated rejection letter stating that they wo n't do anything to help me ( please see attached ). \\nThis has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I 've already wasted so much time just trying to get Experian to look at the errors on my credit report and I 'm so frustrated that Experian is intentionally not responding to my inquiries. I need to have this issue resolved immediately. There are many things I need to do with my life and they all involve my credit. But I am not able to move forward all because of this credit bureau! \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     26\n",

              "My husband and I have been trying to refinance our mortgage since XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX MortgageLine, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX. \\nThe company has strung us along, all the while asking for repetitive documents and income statements. We have paid for an appraisal XXXX because the company took so long to process that the XXXX appraisal expired. Each appraisal was {$400.00}. My husband is in the XXXX XXXX and was away XXXX XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The broker implied this was XXXX of the reasons the refinance was taking so long, but my husband signed a XXXX for me to finalize everything. While he was in training, XXXX XXXX asked for more documentation proving his pay. Even though they knew the military pay was temporary, they said the full time work pay stubs were no longer applicable. When my husband returned to his full time employment after military training, we once again had to submit pay and tax returns. XXXX XXXX has checked our credit score multiple times, which is good standing. We have yet to have an answer of why the refinance is taking so long.

I immediately went to my bank and closed the account and reopened a new one and received new checks with a different account number. The person who stole my wallet had used my debit card ... but since it was still pending ... the bank was able to block the withdrawal. I placed a fraud alert on my credit reports and I got a new driver 's license and then ended up getting a XXXX one with my new name since I had married. \n",
            "Last week I received a letter from Meade & Associates attempting to collect on a debt from XXXX checks written on my old account with my old drivers license name starting in XX/XX/XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX and he agreed that everything was done correctly, I just needed to send him the information from my bank and the police report along with my current drivers license. I requested that he send me copies of the checks that were written, which he did. I went to my bank and they did not have anything specific since nothing actually went through my account at the time. However, they new I had closed that account and reopened the new one and that I had presented them with a police report. They wrote me a letter to give to XXXX XXXX and I was able to retrieve the police report online. Monday, XXXX XXXX, I faxed both of these documents along with my current drivers license, my actual signature, as well as the new police report number for the case filed with the forgery/fraud department. I followed up with a call to XXXX XXXX on Tuesday and was informed he was not available, but they would have him return my call. I called Wednesday afternoon and was then told that he had left early that day without returning my call. I asked if anyone else could help. I was transferred to XXXX. She obtained the documents that I had faxed and I explained to her I wanted to finalize clearing this ordeal. She became hateful and kept saying she needed documents that I she already had. She stated I still needed an affidavit from my bank stating I did not write the checks ... she refused to listen to anything I had to say and acted is if it did not matter what I sent ... it was n't going to make a difference. At that point I definitely became angry and she told me to never call that office again. I called my bank and told them what was going on and they stated that XXXX did not know what she was talking about because the bank never had me sign an affidavit because nothing had actually gone through my account since I had immediately blocked all transactions due to closing the account. The check transactions even clearly say that when they were processed there was no account found. I am currently waiting for my case to be assigned to a detective ... but I am filing reports and claims to help prevent any more aggravation from this company and hope they will learn that you ca n't treat people like criminals when they are the victims in some circumstances ... especially when they present facts and proof. \n",

I even threatened to call the police to no avail. It was as if they were protecting their client from being identified. They would not give me the name of the mortgage company allowing me to make contact. I had to research the county records to find out whom the previous mortgage holder was. I found FlagStar Bank had held the previous mortgage so I called XXXX and when they asked whom my mortgagor was I told them Flagstar bank, they then confirmed that it was Flagstar Bank that I need to make pay or make arrangements with. I contacted the assistant to the President of Flagstar and was told I would need to file a request on XXXX of their forms and they would get back to me. I then informed him no way in heck was I going to file a claim on XXXX of their stupid forms and they better darn well pay for my damages that they had caused to be done or I \\'d file suit against them. To make this short he did agree to check it out and they did finally admit their wrong doing but would n\\'t offer what I thought was a fair offer regarding my damages. I have started a legal suit against them. My concern is how many times have they already done this and/or how many more times will they repeat it? You folks ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ) fined this same bank XXXX XXXX dollars for their improper mortgage practices in XXXX of XXXX. File No XXXX. Yet they seem not to care, The excuse I was given we are in the process of changes some of our policies and this must have slipped through the cracks. This is suppose to be a Financial Institution that follows the legal banking rules and regulations? Attempting to repossess a property XXXX for the same loan that they had already gone through the process of returning it for the government loan guarantee and HUD had already resold.
